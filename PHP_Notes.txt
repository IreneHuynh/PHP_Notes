This is where I will be posting my PHP notes!


The book I learning PHP from is Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript by Robin Nixon

We can just insert it into the HTML body

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
echo "My first PHP script!";
?>

</body>
</html>

Chapter 3: Introduction to PHP------------------------------------------------
  To trigger the PHP command use the open and closing tags <?php ... ?>
          An example would be:
            <?php
              $txt = "PHP";
              echo "I love $txt!";
            ?>
  To comment out line use // or /* */ for multi lines
          //this line would be commented out
          /*
          these lines
          would be 
          commented out
          */
  Must place a $ infront of all variables  
          for instance $x= 10;
 Variables
          When it comes to strings, when we declare variables and want to make photocopies of it, 
          we just declare another variable that is assigned to the same value
          <?php
            $username ="Fred Smith";
            echo $username;
            echo "<br>";
            $current_user = $username;
            echo $current_user;
          ?>
   Constants 
        unlike variable constants stay constants, need to be defined, and don't need to start with the $ symbol
        define("MINSIZE", 50);
        echo MINSIZE;
        echo constant("MINSIZE"); // same thing as the previous line
   Arrays 
          similar to javascript and many other languages have key value pairs as well
          $array = array("1" => "PHP code tester Sandbox Online",  
                    "foo" => "bar", 5 , 5 => 89009, 
                    "case" => "Random Stuff: " . rand(100,999),
                    "PHP Version" => phpversion()
                    );
              
          foreach( $array as $key => $value ){
              echo $key."\t=>\t".$value."\n";
          }
   Logical Operators
          Very similar to other scripting languages
          +	Addition	$x + $y	Sum of $x and $y	
          -	Subtraction	$x - $y	Difference of $x and $y
          *	Multiplication	$x * $y	Product of $x and $y
          /	Division	$x / $y	Quotient of $x and $y	
          %	Modulus	$x % $y	Remainder of $x divided by $y
          **	Exponentiation	$x ** $y	Result of raising $x to the $y'th power
          
   Strings and Concatenation
          Concatenattion uses the period . to append one string of character to another
          We can concatenate with .=
          echo "you have " . $msg . " messages.";
          $bulletin .= $newsflash;
          
   Single and double quotions
          Double quotations will evaluate $value while 
          Single quotations will be print out $value
          To correct appostrophes us backslash someone\'s
   
   Large Lines prints
          <<<_END blah blah
          blah blah blah
          _END;
          
   Decision Making
        Vary similar to many coding languages we have if, else if and else
        if (condition)
           code to be executed if condition is true;
        elseif (condition)
           code to be executed if condition is true;
        else
           code to be executed if condition is false;
   Loop Typtes
        Again similar to many programming languages the loop types are
        for − loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
        while − loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true.
        do...while − loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true.
        foreach − loops through a block of code for each element in an array.
