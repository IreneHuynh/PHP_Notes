This is where I will be posting my PHP notes!


The book I learning PHP from is Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript by Robin Nixon

Chapter 3: Introduction to PHP
  To trigger the PHP command use the open and closing tags <?php ... ?>
    An example would be:
      <?php
        $txt = "PHP";
        echo "I love $txt!";
      ?>
  To comment out line use // or /* */ for multi lines
    //this line would be commented out
    /*
    these lines
    would be 
    commented out
    */
  Must place a $ infront of all variables
