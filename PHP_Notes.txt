This is where I will be posting my PHP notes!


The book I learning PHP from is Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript by Robin Nixon

Chapter 3: Introduction to PHP------------------------------------------------
  To trigger the PHP command use the open and closing tags <?php ... ?>
          An example would be:
            <?php
              $txt = "PHP";
              echo "I love $txt!";
            ?>
  To comment out line use // or /* */ for multi lines
          //this line would be commented out
          /*
          these lines
          would be 
          commented out
          */
  Must place a $ infront of all variables  
          for instance $x= 10;
 Variables
          When it comes to strings, when we declare variables and want to make photocopies of it, 
          we just declare another variable that is assigned to the same value
          <?php
            $username ="Fred Smith";
            echo $username;
            echo "<br>";
            $current_user = $username;
            echo $current_user;
          ?>
   Arrays 
          similar to javascript and many other languages have key value pairs as well
          $array = array("1" => "PHP code tester Sandbox Online",  
                    "foo" => "bar", 5 , 5 => 89009, 
                    "case" => "Random Stuff: " . rand(100,999),
                    "PHP Version" => phpversion()
                    );
              
          foreach( $array as $key => $value ){
              echo $key."\t=>\t".$value."\n";
          }
   Logical Operators
          Very similar to other scripting languages
          
   Strings and Concatenation
          Concatenattion uses the period . to append one string of character to another
          We can concatenate with .=
          echo "you have " . $msg . " messages.";
          $bulletin .= $newsflash;
          
   Single and double quotions
          Double quotations will evaluate $value while 
          Single quotations will be print out $value
          To correct appostrophes us backslash someone\'s
   
   Large Lines prints
          <<<_END blah blah
          blah blah blah
          _END;
